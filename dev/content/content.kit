                With over 200 acres of growing crops, there’s always something going on at the farm! Ciderbrook Farms is a great place for those looking for a fun, family-oriented atmosphere, both inside our Market & Bakery and outside on the Farm!

                Our beautiful farm aims to provide the community with fresh local produce and opportunities to experience the great outdoors. We offer all our crops already picked for you in our Farm Market or you can Pick Your Own. We also offer fresh produce from neighbor farms in Chester and Lancaster counties.
